# apps-on-azure-blog

This is the content for [https://apps-on-azure.net] - a blog written by me for development stuff I am doing.  It uses [Jekyll][jekyll] to generate content with the [Minimal Mistakes][jekyll-theme] theme.

## Editing content

This blog contains a devcontainer.  You can either create a  codespace, or (more normally) re-open this blog in a devcontainer within VS Code.  For more information, see [Developing inside a Container][vscode-devcontainer].
